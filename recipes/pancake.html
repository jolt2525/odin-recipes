            <ul>
                <li>600 grams of flour</li>
                <li>3 TBSP of sugar</li>
                <li>2 TSP of salt</li>
                <li>1 TSP of baking powder</li>
                <li>1 TSP of baking soda</li>
                <li>600 ml of butter milk (if you only have normal milk add 2-3 
                    TBSP of lemon juice or viniger and let it rest for 10 minutes)
                </li>
                <li>110 grams of butter (melt this before use)</li>
                <li>2 eggs</li>

            </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
            <h3>Instruction</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>In a bowl add the flour, sugar, salt, baking powder and 
                    baking soda</li>
                    <li>Whisk together untill ingredients are uniform</li>
                    <li>In the second bowl add the butter milk, 
                        <strong>melted</strong> butter and 2 egg yokes.</li>
                    <li>Whisk the wet ingredients untill the mixture is consistant</li>
                    <li>Now add the two bowls together and mix them, be carful
                        not to over mix them as this is where we will get the texture we
                        are looking for. What you are looking for is a kinda lumpy texture 
                        mixed just enough for it to be some what cohesive. If there are some 
                        small patches of flour showing dont worry that should be fine.
                    </li>
                    <li>Add the egg white of one egg into the batter and mix untill the white
                        of the egg is mixed in. Remember we dont want the batter smooth were looking 
                        for a lumpy texture, take your time working the batter at this stage i recomend
                        folding the egg white in.
                    </li>
                    <li>Let the batter sit for 20 to 30 minutes</li>
                    <li>Cook in a pan on medium heat with butter</li>
                    <li>When you see little bubbles comming up through the batter thats the sign 
                        that its ready to be fliped. once fliped it will only need 30 seconds to 
                        a minute on the other side as most of the cooking is already done.
                    </li>
                    <li>Finaly enjoy your panckes!</li>
            </ol>
